# 1980-ChessBoard
## Lab: Class 11 - Numpy Arrays
<br>

### Implementation Notes
#### Define a ChessBoard class
#### should contain an 8x8 grid
#### Each cell in grid should have a color represented in RGB format.
- black = (0,0,0)
- white = (1,1,1)
- blue = (0,1,1)
- red = (1,.2,0)
#### should have add_red method that accepts a row and column as input which colors corresponding cell.
#### should have add_blue method that accepts a row and column as input which colors corresponding cell.
#### should have render method that displays the chess board on screen with red and blue shown in correct locations
#### should have is_under_attack method that return boolean if red is under attack by a blue piece horizontally, vertically or diagonally
#### Diagonal attacks can come from four directions. Make sure to handle all of them.
#### Render your board for each is_under_attack scenario:
- Horizontal (aka same row).
- Vertical (aka same column).
- Four Diagonals.
- A “Not Under Attack” scenario.

<br>
<br>

### User Acceptance Tests
#### There are no acceptance tests required.
#### But Notebook should clearly show the various is_under_attack scenarios have been handled.

<br>
<br>

### Configuration & Submission
#### Kaggle is an excellent all around resource and has good, free notebook hosting.
